# Fake News Detection Using AI

## Overview
This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The model classifies news
text as real or fake based on patterns in language.

## Objectives
- Analyze textual data from news articles
- Convert text into numerical features using NLP techniques
- Train a machine learning model to classify fake and real news

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF)

## Status
Project initialized. Dataset selection and preprocessing in progress.

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned by removing an unnecessary index column and
dropping rows with missing values. Article text was preprocessed by
converting to lowercase, removing URLs, punctuation, numbers, and extra
whitespace. This step prepares the data for NLP-based feature extraction.
